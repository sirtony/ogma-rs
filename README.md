# Ogma

An embedded, minimalistic key-value store with disk persistence.

# Motivation

I needed an embedded key-value store that could persist data between app restarts and decided it would be fun to take a crack at it myself.

# Ports

For the C# implementation, see [sirtony/ogma](https://github.com/sirtony/ogma).
